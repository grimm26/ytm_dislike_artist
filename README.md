# ytm_dislike_artist

[YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com) does not currently have a way to dislike an artist and/or to keep that artist's music from being suggested or included in random/radio mixes.
In order to work around this, I wrote a python script that uses [ytmusicapi](https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi) to dislike all songs by a given artist.  This should keep YTM from suggesting them to you and inserting them into auto-generated playlists.
